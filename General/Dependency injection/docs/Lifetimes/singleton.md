# Singleton Dependency Injection Definition

The Singleton design pattern is one of the most commonly used design patterns in programming. Its goal is to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global point of access to that instance. In .NET, the Singleton is often used to manage resources that should be shared throughout the entire application. In this article, we will discuss what the Singleton pattern is, what its advantages and disadvantages are, how to implement it in .NET, when to use it, and when to avoid it.

## Singleton Benefits
- <strong>Global Access</strong>: Singleton provides global access to its sole instance, making it easier to manage shared resources.
- <strong>Instance Control</strong>: Since there is only one instance of the Singleton class, you can precisely control when and how it is created and manage its state.
- <strong>Resource Savings</strong>: It allows for resource savings by sharing one instance of the class instead of creating multiple instances.

## Singleton Disadvantages
- <strong>Potential concurrency issues</strong>: If Singleton holds state that can be changed by multiple threads, it can lead to concurrency problems.

## When to use Singleton?
- <strong>Application Configuration</strong>: Singleton is ideal for storing configuration settings that should be globally accessible throughout the application.
- <strong>Logging</strong>: Enables centralized logging management, ensuring that all application components use the same logger instance.

## Implementation
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register service as Singleton
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IService, SingletonService>();

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```
